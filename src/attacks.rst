There are a lot of reasons why someone might want to gain access to your website. 
It's possible that they don't like you or your organization. It could be that 
you are competition or even a disgruntled employee. Some do it just for the 
challenge. 

Unfortunately, there are also government and corporations who are engaging in
this type of activity. It is useful to highlight some of the actors who may
want to compromise your site. 

Pharma Attacks
--------------

One of the most common attacks is simply to increase traffic to a website. This 
site might include malware on it, but much of the time the goal is simply to 
increase page views either through actually redirecting your visitors or 
affecting the target site's Search Engine Optimizaiton. 

One of the challenges about this type of activity is that you may not know that
your site is compromised for quite some time. You really don't want to find out
that your site has been compromised by reading a `national newspaper`_ .

Pharma hacks will likely maintain a backdoor that allows the cracker to insert
files and modify the database. They may modify the database, add files to your 
server and modify existing files to insert malicious code. 

There are a few descriptions on how to `diagnose and clean a pharma attack`, but 
if you've followed the guidelines outlined here, you should be fine. There are
enough sites which aren't properly secured that it is likely that a cracker will
give up and try to compromise another site.
